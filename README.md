<br>
For this assignment you are to analyze at least 2 random number generators and tell me how good you think they are. Use one random number generator from the programming-language library of your choice, and write the other one yourself. Make sure the one you write does not use the same algorithm as the one from the library.

When you analyze the random number generators, you are to look at both the distribution of values and the sequences of values.

Turn in your code for the random number generator that you write and turn in a write up of your analysis.
